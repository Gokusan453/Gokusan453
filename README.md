## Hi there 👋

I'm a 22-year-old programming student currently studying at Arteveldehogeschool in Ghent, Belgium.
I’m passionate about backend development and constantly driven to improve my skills and deepen my understanding of how things work behind the scenes. 
I love tackling challenges, building structured systems, and learning new technologies to grow as a developer.
